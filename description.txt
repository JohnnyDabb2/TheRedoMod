This mod currently adds 4 items and 1 boss.  There is far more content coming, so downloading it now wouldn't be a bad idea.  The homepage is a link to this mod's discord server!



CURRENT FEATURES

1) The Money Trough can now be crafted with a piggy bank and 100 cloud, making it far easier to obtain.

2) Players created with this mod installed will have a new item in their inventory, the Goodie Bag.  Right click on this item for a pleasant surprise!

3) New Boss!  Princess Pinky can be spawned with a Pinky Crown.  Sadly, I'm still working on her AI.  Long story short, she doesn't do much at the moment.

4) New Bug Net!  The Titanium Catcher can be crafted with 20 titanium bars and 1 golden bug net.  It doesn't work yet.

5) More items are in the mod, however they are unobtainable.  If you want everything this mod has to offer, download a mod like Cheat Sheet and spawn in the items via the browser.



THE NEXT UPDATE

1) Princess Pinky will actually do something.

2) The Titanium Catcher will work like the Bug Net.

3) The Adamantite Catcher will be added.

4) A Princess Pinky treasure bag will be added, along with a new yoyo to go with it.
