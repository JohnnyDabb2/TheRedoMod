This mod currently adds 5 items and 1 boss.  There is far more content coming, so downloading it now wouldn't be a bad idea.  If you have any questions, please join the discord server by clicking the homepage button!




CURRENT FEATURES

1) The Money Trough can be crafted with a piggy bank and 70 cloud, as long as you are standing near your Ancient Manipulator!

2) Princess Pinky is a new boss that can be spawned with a Pinky Crown.  If you want to know more information about this boss, let me know on the discord server.

3) You'll have a new starting item in your inventory, the Goodie Bag.  Right click on this item for a pleasant surprise!

4) Lavaspark Footwear can be crafted at the Tinkerer's Workshop with Lava Waders and Frostspark Boots.  Sadly, they're still a huge work in progress.  As of right now, they give you the Spelunker buff for some reason.  This will be fixed in the next update.

5) With only five dirt, an Invisible Block can be crafted at the Ancient Manipulator.

6) There's only a few things that I didn't mention here.  I'll try to include every from now on.
