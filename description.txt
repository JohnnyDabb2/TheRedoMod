This mod currently adds 7 items and 1 boss.  There is far more content coming, so downloading it now wouldn't be a bad idea.  If you have any questions, please let me know me on the discord server.  You can join it by clicking the homepage button!



CURRENT FEATURES

KNOWN ISSUES

(1)  The Rockin' Roller doesn't make a guitar sound when swung.  I'm thinking about having it use a custom sound instead of the same one that The Axe uses.

(2)  If the Boss Checklist mod is enabled, Princess Pinky WILL be on the list.  However, she will remain unchecked even after you defeat her.
